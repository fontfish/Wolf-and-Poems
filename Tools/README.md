Tools I have made to help in the production and layout of the book.

`<fibonacci.sh>` is the initial bash script I made to use a Fibonacci sequence to provide a ratio for a “golden rectangle”, used in page layout.
`<fibonacci.py>` is a very small Python3 script that does the same thing, but in Python3.
