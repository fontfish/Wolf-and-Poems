# A very rough and incomplete overview of FOSS vertical text support in the programs that I am aware support it.

*Most of the below is rather garbled just now and I intend to improve on it. I hope it is not taken as negativity so much as a critical look at what is available.*

##### CSS & html

CSS has implemented vertical text support very well, in a way which I think should perhaps be taken as an example when implementing vertical text features. Not only can vertical and RTL text be used in its own blocks of text, but even within lines of another text direction. East Asian language features such as ruby text are also supported.

##### Inkscape
https://inkscape.org/

This is the program I used to produce this poetry booklet. Inkscape has come a long way since I first used it, and is one of my favourite FOSS programs for the level of adaptability and useability it has for typesetting options. It is, however (and for good reason), what it aims to be – vector graphics software. This limits it slightly within the range of text-related software.

##### Libreoffice
https://www.libreoffice.org/

Libre Office has also improved in this area. Ruby text is supported and multiple text directions can even be implemented by using text boxes.

##### Scribus
https://www.scribus.net/

Scribus has improved since I first attempted to use it, and I would happily recommend its use in publishing simple LTR text. Typographically, however, it still has a way to go – no vertical text yet (though RTL is now implemented in the 1.5 testing versions.

#### In Short

Vertical and RTL text support has improved massively, but is still limited to a select few programs.
