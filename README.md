# 狼、その他の詩 Wolf and Other Poems

These are a set of poems I translated (with much help) from Japanese in 2015 for a project that was funded by a youth arts program where I live. A friend then provided Scots translations, working together with me to strike a balance between all three languages. The project then involved typesetting and printing that work to produce a small book, for which tasks I had decided to use only FOSS software for both budget and proof of concept reasons.


## Tools

Inkscape, FontForge, pdftk

## Rationale

By uploading this to Github, I hope to explain some reasons as to why I think better implementation of vertical text support in FOSS software is necessary and give my own overview (and only my own, from a purely subjective standpoint) of the useability of Open Source tools in traditionally “professional” tasks such as desktop publishing.

I also hope to promote multi-cultural translation and communication, provide some examples of poetry translation from Japanese to English in the hope that someone may find them useful and, if possible, improve the relationship between open source software, translation and multicultural design and media. I would also like to note that better support for RTL and vertical text also provides opportunity for interesting and useful design within software GUIs and layout

### Current state of vertical text support in FOSS software

Vertical text in proprietary software is, for the most part, limited to a select few programs. While I imagine those programs likely implement it well, they are still few and far between. This strikes me as an area where a move forward in free software could push a few boundaries.

In Open Source software, most vertical text support is not implemented to the equivalent standard as horizontal text support within the same program. Theoretically, the implementation of [Pango](https://pango.gnome.org/) and [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) should have made vertical text implementation a breeze, but as yet the ability to use it is rather limited.

Several languages make use of vertical text on a regular basis in signage, book and media production, letter-writing and graphic design. At least one or two written languages use vertical text exclusively.

The FOSS world has the opportunity to allow cross-cultural and multilingual typesetting and publishing to be a much more accessible reality and I believe that it's a loss to not do so to the fullest extent possible. Free software should be about more than *just* software if it hopes to grow its sphere of application. Again, this is only my opinion, however.

With my own current level of programming ability, there is little I can do about this. In future, however, I hope to be able to contribute more to non-LTR text layout in Open Source software.
