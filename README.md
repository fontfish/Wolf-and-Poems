# 狼、その他の詩 Wolf and Other Poems

Poems translated from Japanese into English and Scots.

## Tools

Inkscape, FontForge

## Rationale

By uploading this to Github, I hope to explain some reasons as to why I think better implementation of vertical text support in FOSS software is necessary and promote multi-directional typesetting.

I also hope to promote multi-cultural translation and communication, provide some available examples (though I can't judge my own work)

#### Current state of vertical text support in FOSS software

Bad.

##### CSS

CSS has implemented vertical text support well and properly, in a way which I think should perhaps be taken as example when implementing vertical text features.

##### Inkscape

##### Libreoffice

##### Scribus

Pango.

## With Thanks
